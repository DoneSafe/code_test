# Donesafe Code Test

## A few notes about this test
This test is here to give people an opportunity to show off their skills.  It isn't supposed to be super realistic or strenuous to you as a candidate.   You should be spending a bit of time on this but if you've suddenly found yourself spending too long (>= 8 hours) on it get in contact at <careers@donesafe.com> and talk to us about it.  There are a few things to point out:
* We have an implementation of this code already, so don't get bound up in production issues
* We don't mind what language and/or framework you use, if it's code we should be geek enough to get it.  Though please feel free to explain your architectural choices ðŸ™‚
* This is about your thinking, we'd love to see your thinking
* Have some fun, be creative ðŸ˜‰
* Engineering values like TDD are important to us, so they should be evident in your submission


## Background
Here at Donesafe there are a couple of important numbers that our customers rely on.

One of the most sensitive calculations is for [worker's compensation][1].  In particular, as part of their worker's compensation we use a calculation called [PIAWE][2].  PIAWE is the way we work out how much someone who is unable to work gets paid.

In this case we have four people (found in `people.json`) who need payments.  PIAWE is a confusing and difficult thing for both employees and employers but for the purposes of this code test you'll be pleased to know we're going to simplify things a bit ðŸ™‚

There's a sliding scale of payments based on how long you've been injured, and how you get paid (this can be found in `rules.json`).  Our job at Donesafe is to make sure the worker is getting the correct payment.  It's also to make sure the employer is fulfilling their obligations to the employee and regulatory authorities.

We picked this problem because it's indicative of life at Donesafe, there's some number crunching but a lot of this is helping people navigate a complex problem.  Our users are usually not developers, in many cases they don't see computers as a big part of their job.  So if you're thinking about interface think about what's a good way to talk to people who aren't likely to be comfortable around computers.

## File Structure
### people.json
This is the list of people who need workers compensation payments.
Each person has:
* name - the employee's name
* hourlyRate - how much they are paid per hour
* overtimeRate - how much they are paid per overtime hour
* normalHours - the number of hours per week they usually work
* overtimeHours - the number of hours they get paid overtime for
* injuryDate - when they were injured

### rules.json
This is the set of rules used to calculate payments for people.
Each rule has:
* applicableWeeks - the number of weeks from the date of injury this level of payment is used at
* percentagePayable - what percentage of an employee's qualifiying wage is due back to the employee
* overtimeIncluded - whether overtime hours are part of the qualifying wage


## The tasks
There are a few choices here so you can choose which one to do, but you'll need to do at least one ðŸ™‚

* How much should we pay each of the injured people in `people.json` this week?
* Can you calculate and list their payments for each of their injuries in a report?
* One of these people is going to get significantly less than the others
  a) work out who it is?
  b) imagine they don't know and prepare a notification to send them?

## Questions
OK, we *think* that should be enough to get you rolling.  However, we aren't perfect so if you spotted a mistake or you have a question please contact us <careers@donesafe.com> and we'll work it out with you.
